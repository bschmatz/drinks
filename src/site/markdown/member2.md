## Tasks
A short overview over the branches and my main tasks in them are listed below. Generally I was mainly in charge of `README`
file and the description of the project which comes with it. 

**readme**
- creating the project description and writing the task list

**drink**
  - implementing the `getVolume()`

**queue**
  - create `DrinkQueue` class and pushing it to the remote repository for the other members
  - queueDZ (a side branch we decided to create for the queue branch to work on different methods each)
    - `create constructor` for the `DrinkQueue` class
    - implement `add()`

**javadoc**
  - document `DrinkQueue` with comments on what the methods are doing

**tests**
  - implement tests for `DrinkQueue` 
    - `setup` adds 2 for the tests created liquids to a "liquids" list, after emptying it before every testcase
    - `testAdd()` tests, if adding a drink to the `DrinkQueue` works as intended
    - `testPeek()` tests, if the first added drink actually is first in `DrinkQueue`
    - `testRemove()` tests, if the removed drink is actually removed from the `DrinkQueue`

**double_queue**
  - create `DoubleQueue` class
    - double_queueDZ (another side branch for each member was created to make the workflow smoother)
      - create constructor
      - implement `add()`

**maven_site**
  - create `member3.md`, a more detailed collection of each task a member had completed
